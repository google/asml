# How to Contribute

Although we value feedback and opinions on the controls listed in the
Application Security Maturity Levels, we are not accepting PULL requests for
changes to this project at this time.

## What if I feel strongly that something is missing from a domain?
If you feel strongly that something is missing, please feel free to reach out to
us to start a dialogue.

## What if I'd like to get involved?
The ASML project is currently limited to Google security team, however you may
wish to view the [Minimum Viable Secure Product (MVSP)](https://mvsp.dev)
project which is run by an industry working group of companies.
